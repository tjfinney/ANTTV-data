# NTMSS

NTMSS (New Testament manuscripts) provides data relating to New Testament textual variation. See [How to Discover Textual Groups](https://www.digitalstudies.org/articles/10.16995/dscn.291/) for an introduction.

These have been compiled from numerous sources (see below). The data matrices (also known as [design matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_matrix)) are comprised of rows for textual witnesses (e.g. Greek manuscripts, lectionaries, early versions, patristic citations) and columns for readings (represented by numeric or alphabetic codes) at variation sites (i.e. places where the witnesses have varying textual states). The [distance matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) are typically derived from published tables of percentage agreements.

Most of this data is mirrored at the following Zenodo repositories:

* [Data matrices](https://zenodo.org/record/4064629)
* [Distance matrices](https://zenodo.org/record/4064631)

A companion R package named [ANTTV](https://github.com/tjfinney/ANTTV) contains functions for performing various kinds of multivariate analysis on these data and distance matrices.
