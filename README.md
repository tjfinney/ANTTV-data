Please see [How to Discover Textual Groups](https://www.digitalstudies.org/articles/10.16995/dscn.291/) for an introduction to the analysis techniques.

# Data sets

The data sets have been compiled from numerous sources. Data matrices (also known as [design matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_matrix)) are derived from various critical editions, specialist monographs, dissertations, and online data sets. They are comprised of rows for textual witnesses (e.g. Greek manuscripts, lectionaries, early versions, patristic citations) and columns for readings (represented by numeric or alphabetic codes) at variation sites (i.e. places where the witnesses have varying textual states). [Distance matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) are typically derived from published tables of percentage agreements.

# Sources

Please see table 2 of [Views of New Testament Textual Space](https://www.tfinney.net/Views/index.xhtml) for information on the sources of these data sets.

# Mirrors

A number of the data sets are mirrored at the following Zenodo repositories:
