# NTMSS

NTMSS (New Testament manuscripts) provides R functions for multivariate analysis of data relating to New Testament textual variation. See [How to Discover Textual Groups](https://www.digitalstudies.org/articles/10.16995/dscn.291/) for an introduction.

Input data can be found in a Zenodo repository that includes data and distance matrices compiled from a number of sources. The data matrices (also known as [design matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_matrix)) are comprised of rows for textual witnesses (e.g. Greek manuscripts, early versions, patristic citations, lectionaries) and columns for readings (represented by numeric or alphabetic codes) at variation sites (i.e. places where the witnesses have varying textual states). The [distance matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) are typically derived from tables of percentage agreements.
