# NTMSS

NTMSS (New Testament manuscripts) is a site for data and analysis related to the text of the New Testament. See [How to Discover Textual Groups](https://www.digitalstudies.org/articles/10.16995/dscn.291/) for an introduction.

The data, analysis scripts, and analysis results are divided into a number of directories:

## Data

Data matrices give textual variation sites (columns) and codes representing witness readings (rows). Readings may be encoded as numerals or letters.

## Distances

Distance matrices give distances between witnesses calculated using the simple matching coefficient. Distances are only calculated for witness pairs that share enough variation sites where the readings of both witnesses are known. ("Enough" usually means at least 15 sites.)

## Scripts

R scripts for calculations and analysis.
